## MACHINE CONFIGURATION
| Machine | Drive | Project Path |
|---|---|---|
| Office laptop | C: | C:\Projects\new-b2c-assessment-keySkillset |
| Home laptop | D: | D:\Projects\new-b2c-assessment-keySkillset |
*Always detect the current machine's drive before running path-dependent commands.*

## SUPABASE / SQL WORKFLOW
- **Supabase MCP is permanently disabled.** Never attempt `mcp__supabase__*` calls.
- All SQL runs manually by the user in the Supabase SQL editor.
- **SQL handoff protocol:**
  1. Write the SQL query into `docs/SQL-RESPONSE.txt` (overwrite the file).
  2. Tell the user to run it and paste the JSON response back into `SQL-RESPONSE.txt`.
  3. Once the user confirms the file is updated, read `SQL-RESPONSE.txt` to get the result.
- If `SQL-RESPONSE.txt` is empty or stale, write the next pending query there and wait.

---

## DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW
1. **Init:** Read `CLAUDE.md` → check `@docs/CLAUDE-HIS.md` → branch.
2. **Schema:** Write SQL with `IF NOT EXISTS` → show user → wait for approval → user runs in Supabase → pastes result to `SQL-RESPONSE.txt`.
3. **Execution:** Read file → minimal targeted changes → no unused imports → `npm run build`.
4. **Commit:** `git status` + `diff` → stage specific files (not -A).
   - Message: Imperative + [KSS-ID] + Co-authored-by: Claude Sonnet 4.6
5. **PRD:** Update local `.md` file in `/prds/` (Manual upload to Atlassian by PO).

---

## GIT & BUILD STANDARDS
- **Branching:** `feat/KSS-[TRACK]-[NNN]` or `fix/KSS-[TRACK]-[NNN]`.
- **Pre-Commit:** `npm run build` MUST pass. No exceptions.
- **Commits:** Never commit directly to `main`.

---

## SELF-CHECK (Run before every commit)
1. Did I touch schema without an authorized KSS-DB-XXX prompt?
2. Does `npm run build` pass?
3. Did I add RLS to any table? (Forbidden)
4. Is there anything in this diff I'm uncertain about?

## ANALYTICS ACCESS RULES (Locked — Apr 16 2026)
> Violations here cause demo regressions. Read carefully before touching any analytics file.

### Analytics Tab Visibility
- Analytics tab is **ALWAYS VISIBLE** for all tiers (Free / Basic / Pro / Premium).
- Never gate the tab itself. The tab shows an empty state ("Complete your first attempt") when there are no completed attempts.
- `hasAnalyticsAccess` guard has been **permanently removed** from `page.tsx`.

### AI Insights Section — Pro + Premium ONLY
- `isAiEligible = userTier === 'professional' || userTier === 'premium'`
- For **Free / Basic**: render a **locked panel** (lock icon + "Upgrade to Pro or Premium" CTA). Do NOT render the "What went well" / "Next Steps" boxes.
- For **Pro / Premium with `aiInsight = null`**: render the section but show "AI insights are not available for this attempt." Do NOT show the upgrade teaser.
- For **Pro / Premium with real `aiInsight`**: render full content.
- The "Unlock AI Insights" nudge button in the tab bar is shown for Free/Basic **only when `activeTab === 'analytics'`**.
- Component: `src/components/assessment-detail/AnalyticsTab.tsx` — `userTier` prop drives all gating.

### Solutions Panel — All Tiers
- Solutions panel (Block 7) is visible to **all tiers** with completed attempts.
- Collapsed row always shows: status icon + answer summary.
  - Correct:  `✓ Correct · Your answer: A`
  - Wrong:    `✗ Wrong · Your answer: B · Correct: A`
  - Skipped:  `— Skipped · Correct: A`
  - NUMERIC:  uses `acceptable_answers[0]` as the correct value display.
  - No data:  `No answer data` (neutral grey, no badge)
- Expanded accordion shows: full question, options (colour-coded), **Marks Earned / Marks Lost two-column**, explanation.
- `marks_awarded` from `attempt_answers` is signed: positive = earned, negative = lost.

### Attempt Count Per Tier (Product Rules)
| Tier | Full Tests | Subject Tests | Chapter Tests |
|------|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| Free | 1 free attempt | 1 free attempt | 1 free attempt |
| Basic | 1 free + 1 paid | 1 free (access gate) | 1 free (access gate) |
| Pro | 1 free + 1 paid | 1 free + 1 paid | 1 free (access gate) |
| Premium | 1 free + 2 paid | 1 free + 2 paid | 1 free + 2 paid |

- "Access gate" = tier prevents taking paid attempts on that test type. Users CAN still take the 1 free attempt and see full analytics on it.
- Free attempt is tracked **per assessment** via `is_free_attempt = true` on the `attempts` row. The `users.free_attempt_used` boolean is a global indicator only — per-assessment free tracking is the source of truth.
- `max_attempts_per_assessment = 6` (1 free + 5 paid) is the platform ceiling. Tiers restrict below this.

### Attempts Tab Ghost Rows — PERMANENTLY REMOVED
- When `useDb = true` (DB has real attempt rows), the ghost "Upgrade to Access" locked rows are **never shown**.
- `isSubscribed()` (in-memory check) is irrelevant when the DB has data — DB is source of truth.
- Component: `src/components/assessment-detail/AttemptsTab.tsx`

### SAT Analytics — DO NOT TOUCH
- `SATAnalyticsTab.tsx` is a separate component managed in another chat session.
- The gate removal in `page.tsx` intentionally exposes SAT analytics to all tiers (Basic users have SAT attempts). This is correct.
- Never add tier-gating logic inside `SATAnalyticsTab.tsx` without explicit instruction.

### Attempt Answers Seeding Notes (Demo Data)
- `attempt_answers.question_id` must reference **real DB UUIDs** from `assessment_question_map → questions`.
- The exam engine uses mock IDs (`english-language-q1` etc.) — these are NOT stored in `attempt_answers`.
- PASSAGE_MULTI questions: answers keyed to parent question ID. Sub-questions fetched from `passage_sub_questions` and displayed nested in expanded accordion.
- AI insight rows go in `attempt_ai_insights` table. One row per `attempt_id`. Pro and Premium eligible attempts should have rows seeded.
