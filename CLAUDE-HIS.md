## COMPLETED WORK LOG

### March 31, 2026 — B2C user profile unified redesign
- `max_attempts_per_assessment` updated to 6 (1 free + 5 paid) for all 8 B2C plans
- `b2c_certificates` table created. RLS OFF. 4 demo rows seeded (HIPAA completions).
  Format: `KSS-{shortCode}-{YYYYMMDD}-{seq}`
- B2C user profile page fully rebuilt into single "Subscriptions & Activity" section
  replacing three separate sections (SubscriptionsHistory, AssessmentPerformanceSection, CoursePerformanceSection)
- `AttemptHistorySlideOver` added (slide-over, page-level single instance)
- Pass/fail removed from SA B2C profile UI only — DB column and exam engine untouched
- `b2c-users.ts`: removed `fetchUserAttempts`, `computeAssessmentSummary`, `UserAttempt`, `AssessmentSummary`
  Added: `fetchPlanAssessments`, `fetchAssessmentAttempts`, `fetchFreeAccessAttempts`,
  `fetchPlanCoveredAssessmentIds`, `fetchB2CCertificate`
  `AssessmentSubscription` type now includes `maxAttempts`
- `recharts` installed (was in package.json but missing from node_modules)

- DB: `b2c_assessment_subscriptions` table created (RLS OFF, 11 seeded rows)
- DB: `b2c_course_subscriptions` table created (RLS OFF, 11 seeded rows)
- Open Decision #3 resolved: assessment plan + course plan subscriptions coexist freely
- B2C user profile: Subscriptions History rewritten (2 sub-sections: Assessment Plan + Course Plans)
- B2C user profile: Course Performance paginated (10/page) + 'Free' badge

### March 27, 2026 — formatCourseType + SINGLE_COURSE_PLAN enforcement
- `formatCourseType()` utility added to `src/lib/utils.ts`, applied platform-wide (10 locations)

### March 25, 2026 — Minor upgrades
- Module status icons: CheckCircle2/CircleDot/Circle per COMPLETED/IN_PROGRESS/NOT_STARTED
- Course % recomputed from module averages (Option A — no DB change)
- Email immutable after creation on all edit surfaces
- Content Creators list: Actions column (View + Edit + Deactivate/Reactivate)
- Assessment Plans cards: 3-dot menu → Pencil icon Edit button in card footer
- PlanContentTab validation: ASSESSMENT plans hide Add Course; COURSE_BUNDLE plans hide Add Assessment

## RESOLVED DECISIONS

**#3 (March 30, 2026):** Assessment plan + individual course plan subscriptions coexist freely.
A user may hold 1 assessment plan (PLATFORM_WIDE OR CATEGORY_BUNDLE — not both) AND N course plan
subscriptions simultaneously. Independent Stripe subscriptions. Cancelling one does not affect the other.
`subscription_tier` on users reflects assessment plan tier only.
